# ðŸšŒ Bus Reservation System

A simple Servlet-based Bus Reservation System with a 40-seat bus running between stops A, B, C, and D. This project is built as a WAR project and deployable on Apache Tomcat 11. The bus runs a single round trip per day with outbound from A â†’ D (stops at B and C) at 8:00 AM and return from D â†’ A (stops at C and B) at 4:00 PM. The seats are arranged in 10 rows Ã— 4 seats per row (1A, 1B, â€¦, 10D). Booking rules prevent double booking and support checking seat availability before reservation. The project uses H2 in-memory database for testing and JDBC with proper transaction management. Servlet-based WAR project is ready for deployment on Tomcat. Prerequisites include Java JDK 17+ installed and configured in PATH, Apache Tomcat 11.x installed (https://tomcat.apache.org/download-11.cgi), and Maven 3.8+ installed. To build the WAR file navigate to project root where pom.xml is located using cd path/to/bus-reservation and run mvn clean package. The WAR file will be generated at bus-reservation/target/bus-reservation.war. To deploy to Tomcat 11 copy the WAR file to Tomcatâ€™s webapps folder using cp target/bus-reservation.war /path/to/tomcat/webapps/, navigate to Tomcat bin folder using cd /path/to/tomcat/bin, and start Tomcat with ./startup.sh (Linux/macOS) or startup.bat (Windows). Tomcat will automatically deploy the WAR. Access the application at http://localhost:8080/bus-reservation. To stop Tomcat use ./shutdown.sh (Linux/macOS) or shutdown.bat (Windows). The project structure is bus-reservation/ with pom.xml, README.md, src/main/java/com/example/busreservation/ containing servlet/ (all servlet classes), dao/ (JDBC DAOs), model/ (POJOs), util/ (DB connection & helpers), resources/ (config files), webapp/ containing index.jsp and WEB-INF/ with web.xml and views/ (JSPs), and test/java/ for tests. Default configuration uses host localhost, port 8080, and context path bus-reservation. When running the client press Enter to use the default values. If Swagger UI is integrated it can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/bus-reservation/swagger-ui/. H2 Database embedded settings: Saved Settings: Generic H2 (Embedded), Driver Class: org.h2.Driver, JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:busdb, User Name: sa, Password: (leave blank). This is an in-memory database, so all data will be lost when the application stops.
